      Hello, my name is Emir. I am Turkish. I am 15 years old and a second year student at Anatolian High School. My software development adventure, which started with developing Windows desktop applications with C# WinForms, currently continues as a Full-Stack Web Developer. When developing web, I generally use html, tailwindcss, css and javascript as front-end languages, while I prefer php or nodejs as back-end. In my web development adventure, I realized that starting a project without designing a website can really cause a lot of problems. That's why I decided to start Figma. From here, I design the first web page and then pass it to the front-end.
