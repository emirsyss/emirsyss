      Hello, my name is Emir. I am Turkish. I am 15 years old and a second year student at Anatolian High School. My software development adventure, which started with developing Windows desktop applications with C# WinForms, currently continues as a Full-Stack Web Developer. When developing web, I generally use html, tailwindcss, css and javascript as front-end languages, while I prefer php or nodejs as back-end. In my web development adventure, I realized that starting a project without designing a website can really cause a lot of problems. That's why I decided to start Figma. From here, I design the first web page and then pass it to the front-end. These days, my interest in mobile application development has increased and I am thinking of starting this adventure with React Native. Additionally, thanks to my entrepreneurial spirit, I constantly run my own start-up initiatives. Along with all the things I mentioned above, I have been doing Software Development for +3.5 years. At the same time, I have been working as a User Interface Designer for about 3-4 months. Thanks to my passion for developing technology, I constantly add new knowledge to myself in this field. My first team adventure started as a Full-Stack Web Developer and Head of Software Department at a start-up called "Rota GiriÅŸimcilik".
